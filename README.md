# svelte-webpack-css-grid-flex-layout
Quick spike to check feasibility of Svelte as a UI framework for Sema/  

First spike was in vanilla JS for testing out CSS-grid and flex responsive layout for the Sema playground
https://jsfiddle.net/franciscobernardo/2w1zmqha/141/

This is a little bit more elaborate spike testeing the previous elements and webpack. As it turns out it is a different implementation. The learning outcome is that the between vanilla JS, React and Svelte, we opted for the Svelte. 

Svelte is very lean, has a very low-entry barrier and I totally agree with its design principles. 

Compilers are the new frameworks!

Check [Sema](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema) so see the final outcome! 


*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*
