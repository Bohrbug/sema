# svelte-webpack-css-grid-flex-layout
Quick spike to check feasibility of Svelte as a UI framework for Sema/  

First spike was in vanilla JS for testing out CSS-grid and flex responsive layout for the Sema playground

This is a little bit more elaborate spike testeing the previous elements and webpack. As it turns out it is a different implementation. The learning outcome is that the between vanilla JS, React and Svelte, we opted for the Svelte. 

Svelte is very lean and refreshing alternative to UI frameworks, has a very low-entry barrier I totally agree with its design principles. 

Check [Sema](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema) so see the final outcome!
