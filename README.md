# svelte-webpack-css-grid-flex-layout
Spike to check feasibility of Svelte as a UI framework for Sema  

First spike was in vanilla JS for testing out CSS-grid and flex responsive layout for the Sema playground

This is a more elaborate spike that turned out with a pretty different implementation. 
The learning outcome is that the between vanilla JS, Reactjs and Sveltejs, we opted for the latter. Svelte is a very refreshing alternative and I totally agree with its design principles. 

Check Sema so see the final outcome!
