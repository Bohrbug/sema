# svelte-webpack-css-grid-flex-layout
Quick spike to check feasibility of Svelte as a UI framework for Sema/  

First spike was in vanilla JS for testing out CSS-grid and flex responsive layout for the Sema playground

This is a little bit more elaborate spike testeing the previous elements and webpack which turned out with a pretty different implementation. The learning outcome is that the between vanilla JS, Reactjs and Sveltejs, we opted for the latter. 

Svelte is a very refreshing alternative and I totally agree with its design principles. 

Check [Sema](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema) so see the final outcome!
