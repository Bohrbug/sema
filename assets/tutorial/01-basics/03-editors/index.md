# Editors 

Code editors are the most important widgets and there are three main types available in the Sema playground: *LiveCode*, *Machine Learning* and *Grammar*. 

Current, Sema supports only one instance of each type of editor, which you will use to live code with different languages.   

All editors provide functions such as "Search" (**cmd-F**/**ctrl-F**) and "Replace" (**shift-ctrl-F**/**cmd-option-F**), and syntax highlighting.  


## LiveCode Editor

The LiveCode Editor—top-left in the dashboard, black background—is where you will live code your music with a specific language syntax. 

The LiveCode Editor also gives you commands through key combinations:

* to evaluate the code and playback sound, use **cmd–Enter** (Mac) OR **ctrl–Enter** (Win/Linux) [*command+Enter*]

* to pause playback and stop sound, use **cmd–.** (Mac) OR **ctrl–.** (Win/Linux) [*command+period*]

* to comment out lines of code in the editor, use **cmd–/** (Mac) OR **ctrl–/** (Win/Linux) [*command+forwardslash*]


## Model Editor

In the *Model Editor* (white background), you can use Javascript to edit and create new machine learning models.



## Grammar Editor

The *Grammar Editor* (grey backgroud) enables you to customize and create new language by defining and editing grammars. 

In the playground, this editor is dependent on the selected liveCode language in the editor.
