## Getting Started with Sema!

Welcome to the Sema tutorial! This will teach you everything you need to know to start live coding audio and music with machine learning and designing your own live coding language.

You can also consult the [API docs](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/tree/master/docs)—if you're impatient to start hacking Sema free-style, use the playground or the source code on github—in the links above.


### What is Sema?

Sema is a playground for designing and performing with live coding scoding languages.

It is similar to other live coding environments and domain-specific languages for sound and music, such as Supercollider, TidalCycles or Gibber.

Uniquely, Sema provides an integrated experience to machine learning and language design. Sema has a real-time, interactive interpreter for machine learning libraries (e.g. [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/)) and a compiler for [BNF grammars](http://hardmath123.github.io/earley.html) as first-class citizens and running client-side.

### How to use this tutorial

This tutorial aims to provide a lightweight introduction and gradual learning experience for you to get going with Sema. We recommended that you go from start to finish. You can navigate the Table of Contents via the dropdown menu above (click 'Introduction').

* Part 1 starts with the basics of the playground interface, including layouts, the live coding editors and the all the available widgets.  

* Part 2 will get you started on live coding with the default language.

* Part 3 will show you some machine learning wizardry with custom neural networks architecture. 

* Part 4 will introduce you to language design concepts and workflow, to help you get started designing your own custom language. 

As you progress through the tutorial, you'll be presented with code and comments designed to illustrate how to use Sema's features. You can copy and paste code in the editors and tweak it to explore the possibilities. 

We recommend that you type it all in manually, the <em>live coding</em> way. And most importantly, have fun!!!
