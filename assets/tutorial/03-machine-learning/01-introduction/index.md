# Introduction: The Machine Learning Window

Machine learning is managed in the 'machine learning' window in Sema.  This is a live coding window, programmed with Javascript.  It can send and receive data to and from the live coding window.  In this window, you can use a selection of machine learning libraries to train and run machine learning models.  You can create processes within this window that are run automatically, and are invisible to the live coder, so that they can use ML transparently.

Follow the instructions in the ML window to learn the basic operations.
